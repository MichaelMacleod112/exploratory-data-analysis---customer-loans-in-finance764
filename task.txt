In this task you will initialise the class and script that you will use to extract the data from the cloud. The definition of the classes and methods are meant as guidance. If you would like to follow a difference project/class structure feel free to do so. The class methods won't be defined in this step, they will be defined once required in subsequent tasks.


Step 1: Create a new Python script db_utils.py 
which will contain your code to extract the data from the database.


Step 2: Within the script create a new class called
 RDSDatabaseConnector. This class will contain the methods 
 which you will use to extract data from the RDS database.

The loan payments data is stored in an AWS RDS database. 
You will need to create the methods which will enable you 
to extract the data from this database.


Step 1: Create a credentials.yaml file 
to store the database credentials.


Remember to add this file to your 

.gitignore file in your repository, as 
you don't want your credentials being pushed 
to GitHub for security reasons.


Add the following credentials to your credentials.yaml 
file which will allow you to connect to the remote database:


RDS_HOST: eda-projects.cq2e8zno855e.eu-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com
RDS_PASSWORD: EDAloananalyst
RDS_USER: loansanalyst
RDS_DATABASE: payments
RDS_PORT: 5432


Step 2: If you haven't already installed 
Python PyYAML package you should do so
 before the next step. This can be installed 
 by running pip install PyYAML in the terminal 
 and imported using import yaml. This will 
 allow you to load your credentials.yaml file as a dictionary.


Step 3: After installing the package
 create a function which loads the 
 credentials.yaml file and returns 
 the data dictionary contained within.
This will be be passed to your RDSDatabaseConnector 
as an argument which the class will use to connect 
to the remote database.


Step 4: Write the __init__ method of your RDSDatabaseConnector class.
 It should take in as a parameter a dictionary of credentials 
 which your function from the previous step will extract.


Step 5: Define a method in your RDSDatabaseConnector class 
which initialises a SQLAlchemy engine from the credentials
 provided to your class. This engine object together with 
 the Pandas library will allow you to extract data from the database.


Step 6: Develop a method which extracts 
data from the RDS database and returns 
it as a Pandas DataFrame. The data is 
stored in a table called loan_payments.


Step 7: Now create another function which
 saves the data to an appropriate file format to your local machine. 
 This should speed up loading up the data when you're performing 
 your EDA/analysis tasks. The function should save the data in .csv 
 format, since we're dealing with tabular data.


With the data being stored locally, create a function 
which will load the data from your local machine into a 
Pandas DataFrame.

In this step you might want to print the shape 
of the data to understand the size of the data you're 
working with. Printing out a sample of the data can 
help give a quick overview of its columns and values. 
The columns names might be quite alien to you if you've 
never used data from the financial domain before. Below 
is a data dictionary which describes all columns of the 
database to help you understand their meaning:

id: Unique id of the loan
member_id: Id of the member to took out the loan
loan_amount: Amount of loan the applicant received
funded_amount: The total amount committed to the loan at that point in time
funded_amount_inv: The total amount committed by investors for that loan at that point in time

int_rate: Interest rate on the loan
instalment: The monthly payment owned by the borrower
grade: Loan company (LC) assigned loan grade
sub_grade: LC assigned loan sub grade
employment_length: Employment length in years

payment_plan: Indicates if a payment plan is in place for the loan. Indication borrower is struggling to pay.
purpose: A category provided by the borrower for the loan request
dti: A ratio calculated using the borrower's total monthly debt payments on the total debt obligations, excluding mortgage and the requested LC loan, divided by the borrower’s self-reported monthly income

earliest_credit_line: The month the borrower's earliest reported credit line was opened
inq_last_6mths: The number of inquiries in past 6 months (excluding auto and mortgage inquiries)
mths_since_last_record: The number of months' since the last public record
open_accounts: The number of open credit lines in the borrower's credit file
total_accounts: The total number of credit lines currently in the borrower's credit file
out_prncp: Remaining outstanding principal for total amount funded
out_prncp_inv: Remaining outstanding principal for portion of total amount funded by investors
total_payment`: Payments received to date for total amount funded
total_rec_int: Interest received to date
total_rec_late_fee: Late fees received to date
recoveries: Post charge off gross recovery
collection_recovery_fee: Post charge off collection fee
last_payment_date: Date on which last month payment was received
last_payment_amount: Last total payment amount received
next_payment_date: Next scheduled payment date
last_credit_pull_date: The most recent month LC pulled credit for this loan
collections_12_mths_ex_med: Number of collections in 12 months' excluding medical collections
mths_since_last_major_derog: Months' since most recent 90-day or worse rating
policy_code: Publicly available policy_code=1 new products not publicly available policy_code=2
application_type: Indicates whether the loan is an individual application or a joint application with two co-borrowers

Update your GitHub repository with the latest code changes from your local project. Start by staging your 
modifications and creating a commit. Then, push the changes to your GitHub repository.

Additionally, document your progress by adding to your GitHub README file. You can refer to the relevant lesson in the prerequisites for this task for more information.

At minimum, your README file should contain the following information:

Project Title
Table of Contents, if the README file is long
A description of the project: what it does, the aim of the project, and what you learned
Installation instructions
Usage instructions
File structure of the project
License information
You don't have to write all of this at once, but make sure to update your README file as you go along, so that you don't forget to add anything.

Refactoring will be a continuous and constant process, but this is the time to really scrutinise your code.

You can use the following list to make improvements:

Meaningful Naming: Use descriptive names for methods and variables to enhance code readability. For example, create_list_of_website_links() over links() and use for element in web_element_list instead of for i in list.
Eliminate Code Duplication: Identify repeated code blocks and refactor them into separate methods or functions. This promotes code reusability and reduces the likelihood of bugs.
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Ensure that each method has a single responsibility, focusing on a specific task. If a method handles multiple concerns, split it into smaller, focused methods.
Access Modifiers: Make methods private or protected if they are intended for internal use within the class and not externally accessible
Main Script Execution: Use the if __name__ == "__main__": statement to include code blocks that should only run when the script is executed directly, not when imported as a module
Consistent Import Order: Organize import statements in a consistent manner, such as alphabetically, and place from statements before import statements to maintain readability
Avoid Nested Loops: Minimize nested loops whenever possible to improve code efficiency and reduce complexity
Minimal Use of self: When writing methods in a class, only use self for variables that store information unique to each object created from the class. This helps keep the code organized and ensures that each object keeps its own special data separate from others.
Avoid import *: Import only the specific methods or classes needed from a module to enhance code clarity and prevent naming conflicts
Consistent Docstrings: Provide clear and consistent docstrings for all methods, explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values. This aids code understanding for other developers.
Type Annotations: Consider adding type annotations to method signatures, variables, and return values to improve code maintainability and catch type-related errors during development
